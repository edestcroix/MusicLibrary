# Music Library

A work-in-progress application to browse and play music from your local music library. Name and most functionallity subject to change.

The base idea is a very simple, paned navigation view that allows filtering by artist -> album -> track only. No other sorting options
are planned on being implemented right now. A play queue to play multiple albums is probably going to happend at some point.


# Planned Features:
    - Selecting albums, filtered by artist.
    - View pane for the album featuring: album art, tracklist, play buttons.
    - Playback of albums.
